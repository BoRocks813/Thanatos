This repository is from team 6672's 2020-2021 FRC season. Due to the need to distance and not have any 
in-person competition, after the official challenges for the season had been completed, the team decided
to hold an in-house competition to teach the freshman at the time about building and coding (on a smaller
scale). The freshmen (along with a few sophomores) broke into three different groups with each having 3-4
build team members and a coder. The teams were called Sputnik, CADaphracti, and Thanatos. This is the code
from team Thanatos. 

After our victory and the sad dismantling of our robot, I decided to repurpose this repository as a tutorial
for incoming members of the 6672 coding team as well as anyone else interested. The tutorial is laid out in 
a linear progression through the files of this repository. The order is listed below and the next one in the
list will be stated at the bottom of each file.

Table of Contents:

1. RobotContainer.java - where the majority of the commands are declared
2. Chassis.java - the drive system of the robot
